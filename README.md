> BeReadable is a simple online tool that helps the user to turn audio into words and it can also record the audio and the user can play it or download it to mp3. BeReadable supports a lot of languages as it sends the user's language selection to Deepgram API and return back the correct transcription for the selected language. The tool is a straight to the point kind of tool, it doesn't have any complexity in using and the UI is quite simple. It has two main features and both of them are incredibly important.
